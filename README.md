## Probabilistic Machine Learning
My solutions and reports from the course "Probabilistic Machine Learning" at Data Science, Wroc≈Çaw University of Technology, 2020.

Containing implementation and application of many probabilistic machine learning algorithms using Pyro, sklearn, PyTorch etc.

Some algorithms : MLE, MAP, MCMC, Bayesian Linear and Logistic Regression, GP, Mixture Models (GMM), PGM, Bayesian Neural Networks, VAE, LDA, HMM.
